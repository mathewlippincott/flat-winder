# ∞ flat line winder ∞
![18" winder with string](images/string.png) 

This kite line winder is designed for a figure eight winding technique. Winding line in a figure eight ∞ folds the line so that there is no twist. The winder is 450mm (18") long. 

Line can also be thrown off the winder rapidly:

# how to make the winder

![winder2-sm.svg](images/winder2-sm.svg)

Download the SVG or DXF file in the root directory and cut from 1/2" plywood or similar material.

 Drill out the pink drill holes with a 25mm (1") hole saw or drill bit, and finish the cuts with hand or power tools. Or use a CNC mill.

1 unit = 1 mm for all SVGs.

# things to change

Consider moving the handles. Their current placement was chosen for rigidity, as cutting out the middle handle can lead to warping given the current shape.

I think I like the side handles when letting line out, and the middle handle when winding line in. I don't know which is better.

# about this project

This design was inspired by sport kite winders and the [G-Kites](https://www.gkites.com/store/) Wooden Line Winder. Winder features I want:

* One person can both wind line and fly the kite.
* Prevents line from twisting.
* Fits in a 5" cardboard tube with a kite.
* Has no moving parts.
* Can be made with basic tools.
* Material efficient and easy to batch.
